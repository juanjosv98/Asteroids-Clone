# Asteroids Clone – 2D C++ Game

This project is a 2D game inspired by the classic **Asteroids**, implemented in **C++** as part of a programming course at the **Technische Hochschule Nürnberg (TH Nürnberg)**. The goal of the project was to practice object-oriented programming by transitioning from C to C++, basic game loops, and simple 2D game mechanics.

The course template and starter framework were provided by **Prof. Enrico Schröder**, and students were required to extend the template into a fully functional game.

## Gameplay

- The player controls a spaceship that can rotate and move in a 2D space  
- Asteroids move across the screen with different directions and speeds  
- The player can shoot projectiles to destroy asteroids  
- Collision detection between spaceship, asteroids and projectiles  
- Simple game state handling (e.g. player hit, game over)

## Concepts & Technologies

- C++  
- Object-oriented design (spaceship, asteroid, projectile, game manager, etc.)  
- Game loop (update and render steps)  
- Basic physics-style movement and collision checks  
- Simple 2D rendering using the framework provided in the course
